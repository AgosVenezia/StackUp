        Tailwind CSS is a popular and <span class="font-bold italic text-sky-500">powerful CSS
        framework </span>that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes

        One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
        consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that

        ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
        <span class="font-bold"> easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span>

        Examples of such utility classes includes the
        <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to center align text,
        while the <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to add a light
        gray background color to an element.
