          'Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over high. Cook 2 lb. ground beef, breaking up with a spoon, until browned but not completely cooked through, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving as much fat in pan as possible.',
          'Reduce heat to medium and cook 2 medium onions, chopped, 2 small red bell peppers, seeded, chopped, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, stirring, until tender but not browned, 6–8 minutes; season with salt and black pepper. Add 3 Tbsp. ground cumin, 2 Tbsp. sweet paprika, 1 Tbsp. dried oregano, and ¼ tsp. cayenne pepper and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1½ cups low-sodium chicken stock or broth and reserved beef along with any accumulated juices to pot. Stir in 2 tsp. sugar, 4 tsp. salt, and ¼ tsp. black pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, until most of the liquid is evaporated, 15–20 minutes; taste and season with salt and black pepper, if needed. Stir in ½ cup raisins. Transfer to a medium bowl, cover, and chill at least 3 hours.',
          'Preheat oven to 375°. Let 3 packages Puff Pastry Dough for Empanadas sit at room temperature 15 minutes to temper. Remove 6 rounds from package, keeping plastic divider underneath, and arrange on a work surface. Place 2 Tbsp. filling in the center of each round.',
