/**
 * Create a new file, containing the given contents.  It is referenced by its FileID, and does not
 * have a filename, so it is important to get the FileID. After the file is created, the FileID
 * for it can be found in the receipt, or retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record
 * of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that.
 *
 * The file contains the given contents (possibly empty). The file will automatically disappear at
 * the fileExpirationTime, unless its expiration is extended by another transaction before that
 * time. If the file is deleted, then its contents will become empty and it will be marked as deleted
 * until it expires, and then it will cease to exist. See FileGetInfoQuery for more information
 * about files.
 *
 * The keys field is a list of keys. All the keys on the list must sign to create or modify a file,
 * but only one of them needs to sign in order to delete the file.  Each of those "keys" may itself
 * be threshold key containing other keys (including other threshold keys). In other words, the
 * behavior is an AND for create/modify, OR for delete. This is useful for acting as a revocation
 * server. If it is desired to have the behavior be AND for all 3 operations (or OR for all 3),
 * then the list should have only a single Key, which is a threshold key, with N=1 for OR,
 * N=M for AND.
 *
 * If a file is created without ANY keys in the keys field, the file is immutable ONLY the
 * expirationTime of the file can be changed using FileUpdate API. The file contents or its keys
 * cannot be changed.
 *
 * An entity (account, file, or smart contract instance) must be created in a particular realm. If
 * the realmID is left null, then a new realm will be created with the given admin key. If a new
 * realm has a null adminKey, then anyone can create/modify/delete entities in that realm. But if
 * an admin key is given, then any transaction to create/modify/delete an entity in that realm
 * must be signed by that key, though anyone can still call functions on smart contract instances
 * that exist in that realm. A realm ceases to exist when everything within it has expired
 * and no longer exists.
 *
 * The current API ignores shardID, realmID, and newRealmAdminKey, and creates everything in
 * shard 0 and realm 0, with a null key. Future versions of the API will support multiple
 * realms and multiple shards.
