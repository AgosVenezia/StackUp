  <h2>How to read carefully</h2>
  <p><em>Everyone</em> should have a purpose for their reading and think about how that purpose is being fulfilled during the actual reading. The advantage for remembering is that checking continuously for how the purpose is being fulfilled helps the reader to stay on task, to focus on the more relevant parts of the text, and to rehearse continuously as one reads.</p>
  <h2>How to code in Solidity</h2>
  <p><em>As</em> a relatively young language, Solidity is advancing at a rapid speed. We aim for a regular (non-breaking) release every 2-3 weeks, with approximately two breaking releases per year. You can follow the implementation status of new features in the Solidity Github project.</p>
  <h2 id="lastheading" style="color: #FFB84B;">How to use Git</h2>
  <p><em>If</em> you've never used Git, you may be nervous about it. There's nothing to worry about—just follow along with this step-by-step getting-started guide, and you will soon have a new Git repository hosted on GitHub.</p>
